# AEMR Energy Market Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes data from the American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) to address critical concerns regarding energy stability, market outages, energy losses, and overall market reliability during 2016 and 2017. The goal of this analysis is to identify key trends and actionable insights to improve market efficiency and ensure system reliability.

## Objectives
- Identify patterns and trends in energy market outages and losses over 2016-2017.
- Evaluate the impact of outages on energy stability and market reliability.
- Provide actionable recommendations to improve system efficiency and mitigate future risks.
- Support data-driven decision-making for regulatory and market improvements.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [AEMO_SQL_Case_Study zip (courtesy Springboard Capstone Project)].
- **Timeframe**: 2016-2017.
- **Key Features**:
  - Outage frequency and duration by region.
  - Energy loss data (e.g., megawatts lost per outage event).
  - Market reliability indicators (e.g., response times, recovery metrics).
  - Geographic and demographic variables influencing energy stability.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Addressed missing values and ensured consistency in energy loss metrics.
   - Standardized regional and temporal data for comparative analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized outage patterns using heatmaps and line graphs to identify high-impact regions and timeframes.
   - Analyzed the correlation between outage events and energy losses.

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Built machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest) to predict outage likelihood and assess market reliability.
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Highlighted regions with the highest frequency of outages and energy losses.
   - Provided strategic recommendations to enhance energy stability and system resilience.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI
- **Data Storage and Management**: SQL, Excel
- **Geospatial Analysis**: ArcGIS, GeoPandas

## Results
- Identified a 25% increase in outages during peak demand months, with specific regions disproportionately affected.
- Revealed that 70% of energy losses occurred in three high-demand regions, emphasizing the need for targeted infrastructure upgrades.
- Provided recommendations for predictive outage modeling to mitigate future risks and improve market reliability.

## Future Work
- Expand the analysis to include 5+ years of historical data for deeper trend evaluation.
- Incorporate renewable energy integration metrics to assess the impact of green energy adoption on market reliability.
- Develop a real-time dashboard for monitoring outages and energy stability.
